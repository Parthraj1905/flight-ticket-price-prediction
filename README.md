# Flight Ticket Price Prediction

This project aims to predict flight ticket prices based on various input features such as airline, source, destination, stops, departure time, etc. The model has been trained using both Scikit-learn and TensorFlow libraries in a single Python script.

## Overview

- Predicts flight prices based on real-world flight features
- Trained using a combination of machine learning and deep learning techniques
- Achieves high accuracy in price prediction
- Web interface or script-based use (customizable)

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Project Structure

- `main.ipynb`: Contains the complete model training and prediction logic using Scikit-learn and TensorFlow.
- `README.md`: This file.
- `economy.csv`: Raw data of the economy class.  
- `business.csv`: Raw data of the business class. 
- `Clean_Dataset.csv`: Processed data of both the economy and business classes. 
- `top_10_routes_data.csv`: Extracted data for top 10 routes, for model building.
 
## Features

- Handles categorical and numerical features
- Preprocessing pipeline included
- High accuracy due to hybrid model approach
- Scalable and adaptable to new data

## Data Source

The dataset was sourced from online flight price listings, but the exact source is unknown.
